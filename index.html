    <h3>20 years of recycling Portland!</h3>  
     <p> A Big thank you to the Village Community for supporting us for all of these years! We’ve managed to create quite a fun way to keep our gently used treasures out of the landfill and into the arms of new owners. I feel proud that every day feels like Earth Day at Village.</p>
