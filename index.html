<h2>ACLU Account at Village Merchants</h2>

<div>
  <p>I became aware that while many people feel an intense desire to DO SOMETHING(!) many also aren’t sure where to direct their energies, and may have limited time, money and/or emotional energy to devote to the causes they most want to protect and promote. So, I have been brainstorming ways to help myself and others contribute in ways that are both do-able, and hopefully, even enjoyable - to combine social action with renewing experiences (of fun, beauty, humor, joy etc) that would help to breathe fresh life into our flickering emotional/spiritual “pilot lights” and help those flames burn brightly as they light our path forward.</p>

  <h2>Four Joys</h2>

  <p>I have long shopped and consigned at Village Merchants, which is a fun, fun, fun!!! store on 41st and SE Division in Portland. As a result of my “social actioon” brainstorming, I have just set up a new consignment account at Village Merchants on behalf of the ACLU, which anyone can contribute to.</p>

  <p>Basically, you would clear out some nice items in good condition that you aren’t using (joy #1 - clear some clutter from your home). You would bring those items in to Village Merchants for them to re-sell or donate, telling them it is for  the ACLU account. (joys #2, #3 and #4: let someone else enjoy the stuff you weren’t using, donate to a good cause if Village Merchants can’t sell it, best of all, help ACLU if Village Merchants can sell it!)</p>

  <p>They carry a broad range of things including clothes, furniture, kitchen and gardening equipment, home decor, books, craft supplies, CD’s/DVD’s…. check out their website for more info.</p>  

 <h2>How to Participate</h2>

  <p>Before bringing stuff in, please review their guidelines for consigners.</p>

  <p>They are so popular that their parking lot is often full, so you may have to walk a block or two with your “stuff.” When you bring items in, you may be asked, “for consignment”? (answer: “yes")  and “donate or returns?” (answer: “donate”).</p>

  <h2>Warning: Irresistible Temptation Likely!</h2>

  <p>Before prepared, once you’re in there you will probably be irresistibly drawn to browse, and maybe, buy….  (FYI, if you see a price tag or label with the letters “AMEN”  or ACLU on it, that means the consignment proceeds from that sale will go to ACLU.)</p>

  <p>Please share this information widely!</p>

  <p>Big thanks to Village Merchants - please drop by to thank them, donate generously and shop to support this store!</p>

  <p>Added note by author: “I am not an affiliated entity with the ACLU. This is an independent effort donating proceeds.”</p>
